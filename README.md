## To-Do / Notes

Some general notes on features to implement, etc.

**Top-Level Menu:**

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- What shortcuts work... 
    - when in a cell editor? 
    - when cell selected (not in editor)? 
    - when no cell selected?

**Notebooks:**
- Cell types
  - SQL
  - Markdown
- Moustache support?
- Cell outputs
  - Tables
  - Charts (vega, chart.js, etc.?)
- Wrap notebook / cell functionality in a class / interface?
